Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning => ML Project

This is a Machine Learning project to predict whether a person has diabetes or not using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

Dataset Used => Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (CSV Format)

Technologies Used =>
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for Data Visualization
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression for prediction)

Steps Performed =>
- Data Cleaning (Replaced 0s with median in Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Correlation heatmap to understand feature impact)
- Model Training using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix

Accuracy =>
Achieved approximately 78% to 82% accuracy in predicting diabetes.

Project Files =>
- diabetes.csv => Dataset file
- Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb => Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible)
- README.md => Project Summary
